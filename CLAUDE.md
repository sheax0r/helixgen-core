# helixgen-core

Core library + CLI that generates Line 6 Helix Stadium `.hsp` presets (and
legacy `.hlx`) from JSON tone specs, and controls a Stadium over the LAN. The
block library lives at `~/.helixgen/library/` (override with
`$HELIXGEN_LIBRARY`) and is built by ingesting real device exports.

**Repo family (all under `sheax0r`):** this repo (`helixgen-core`) is the
Python package `helixgen` — libs and the CLI (the **CLI is the only engine
surface**; the MCP server was removed in 0.20.0 — the per-verb `--help` text
is the agent-facing behavioral contract, pinned by `tests/test_cli_parity.py`);
[`helixgen`](https://github.com/sheax0r/helixgen) is the Claude Code
plugin/marketplace repo carrying the `setup`/`tone`/`device` skills;
[`helixgen-tui`](https://github.com/sheax0r/helixgen-tui) is the terminal UI.
The plugin and TUI consume this repo as a PyPI dependency (package name
`helixgen`, published to PyPI since 0.19.1).

User IRs (impulse responses) registered with `helixgen register-irs` live at
`~/.helixgen/irs/` by default (override with `$HELIXGEN_IRS`). The mapping
file `mapping.json` records `irhash → wav-path`. See `helixgen list-irs`.

**The project backlog lives at `docs/BACKLOG.md`** — check it before starting
new work (its "corrected mental models" preamble first); deferred work and
punted review findings get a numbered entry there, not a TODO comment.

## Home directory and git plumbing (`~/.helixgen`)

Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-15-library-metadata-design.md`
(backlog #22/#35/#36; sequencing in
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-15-library-metadata.md`). This section
describes what **exists today**: the tone half of the artifact library
(`library/tones/<logical-slug>.json` + per-variant `.hsp`, the naming schema,
and the `helixgen library` / `describe` verbs — see "Tone naming and the
library" and "The `helixgen library` verb group" below, further down this
file). Guitar profiles (`library/guitars/`) and per-IR metadata are still
later-PR work and aren't documented here yet.

- **`$HELIXGEN_HOME`** (`src/helixgen/home.py`) is the root of everything
  helixgen persists — default `~/.helixgen`. It centralizes default-path
  computation; the existing per-area overrides (`$HELIXGEN_LIBRARY`,
  `$HELIXGEN_IRS`, `$HELIXGEN_SETLISTS`, `$HELIXGEN_PREFS`, `$HELIXGEN_CACHE`)
  keep working and always win over a `$HELIXGEN_HOME`-derived default.
- **The home becomes a git repo automatically** (`src/helixgen/gitops.py` +
  `src/helixgen/libinit.py`). The first write to the home — a manifest save,
  a block-library ingest, and (in later PRs) a tone/guitar/IR metadata save —
  calls `libinit.ensure_initialized()`, which `mkdir`s the home if needed and
  `git init`s it (writing a `.gitignore` that excludes `devices/`, `cache/`,
  `tone3000/`, `*.bak*`, and IR audio) if it isn't a repo yet. **Repo init is
  unconditional whenever `git` is on PATH** — it does not depend on any
  preference. If git is absent, helixgen warns once to stderr and continues
  without git (advisory only; nothing fails because of a missing repo).
  `ensure_initialized()` is cheap to call from every write path: a
  module-level once-per-process flag skips repeat subprocess work for a home
  already initialized this process.
- **Auto-commit is advisory and preference-gated.** Every manifest save calls
  `gitops.auto_commit(home, message)` afterward, which stages and commits
  everything under the home — but only when the `git_commit_tones` preference
  allows it (default `"auto"`; `"false"` skips the commit). A commit failure,
  a missing git binary, or a load-preferences failure never fails the
  triggering operation — it warns to stderr and moves on. The very first
  write to a fresh home has nothing left to separately commit: `git init`'s
  own `add -A` already captures it as part of the `"helixgen: initialize
  library"` commit; `auto_commit`'s own `"helixgen: update manifest"` message
  shows up starting with the second write.
- **The manifest lives at `~/.helixgen/setlists/manifest.json`** (override
  `$HELIXGEN_SETLISTS`, unchanged) — manifest v3, intent-only (see "The tone
  library / slots" below). A legacy `~/.helixgen/setlists.json` (v1 or v2)
  auto-migrates up to the new location on first load: a `.bak-v1`/`.bak-v2`
  backup is written first, then the legacy file is renamed
  `*.migrated-v2` so a re-run never re-migrates. **Migration note:** because
  a v2→v3 migration also splits per-device observed placement out into
  `devices/legacy.json` (see next bullet), the first `device sync` after
  migrating re-pushes every managed tone once — the device's real serial
  hasn't observed anything yet under its own file, so sync treats the whole
  managed set as needing a (harmless, idempotent) placement refresh.
- **Per-device observed state lives in `~/.helixgen/devices/<serial>.json`**
  (`src/helixgen/device/observations.py`), one file per Helix serial (from
  `device info`'s `/ProductInfoGet`), NOT the manifest and NOT committed
  (`devices/` is gitignored) — it is rebuilt wholesale by every `device
  sync`, so losing it costs nothing.

## CLI

- `helixgen list-blocks [--category amp|cab|drive|delay|reverb|modulation|filter|eq|dynamics|pitch|volume|send]` — list blocks, optionally filtered.
- `helixgen show-block "<name>"` — print a block's exact param names, types, defaults, and observed ranges. **Run this before writing a spec** — param names are case-sensitive and the generator rejects unknown ones.
- **`--json`** — verbs whose output agents consume programmatically take a `--json` flag for machine-readable stdout (`list-blocks`, `show-block`, `list-irs`, `irhash`, `patch`, `controllers`, and the `device` read verbs); `view` prints JSON by default.
- `helixgen generate <recipe.json> [-o <out.hsp>]` — author a preset from a transient recipe (no sidecar is written). `-o` is now **optional**: with no `-o`, `generate` writes into the tone library at `library/tones/<variant-slug>.hsp` and authors per-tone metadata JSON, naming the tone from `--artist`/`--song` (song identity, paired) or `--descriptor` (mutually exclusive with artist/song), plus an optional `--guitar`; with no naming flag the recipe's bare `name` becomes the descriptor. An explicit `-o <out.hsp>` preserves today's exact legacy behavior — writes there, auto-registers, naming flags are ignored, and **no metadata JSON is written**. Output extension `.hsp` writes a Stadium-format file (8-byte magic + compact JSON); `.hlx` writes pretty JSON for the original Helix.
- `helixgen view <preset.hsp> [-o recipe.json]` — read-only projection of a `.hsp` back into the recipe shape (replaces the old `decompile`; `-o` dump is non-authoritative).
- `helixgen ingest <path>` — ingest a `.hsp`/`.hlx`/`.json` file or recurse a directory; first encountered file sets the chassis.
- `helixgen register-irs <preset.hsp> <wav1> <wav2> ...` — bind each unknown `irhash` in the preset (path-then-position order) to the corresponding wav arg. Use `--force` to overwrite existing mappings.
- `helixgen register-irs <wav1> <wav2> ...` — compute each WAV's Stadium hash directly (no device export needed) and register. Requires libsndfile (`brew install libsndfile` on macOS). Only 48 kHz sources supported; non-48 kHz raises an error suggesting `sox`. This 48 kHz limit is a **helixgen** input constraint (it does not resample) — the **device** itself accepts any sample rate and normalizes internally, so a non-48k IR still works once imported onto the hardware; you just can't hash it off-device with helixgen without resampling first. Stereo WAVs are reduced to the left channel (matches Stadium's import).
- `helixgen irhash <wav-or-dir>... [--json]` — compute Stadium hashes **statelessly** (nothing registered; use `register-irs`/`ir-scan` to persist). Directories are recursed for `*.wav`; per-file failures inside a directory walk warn and continue, an explicitly named file that fails is fatal.
- `helixgen ir-scan <dir>... [--rescan] [--remove <basename>]` — recursively walk one or more directories for `*.wav`, compute each Stadium hash, and cache. A WAV is skipped only when it is already registered **and** its cached hash is still valid for the file on disk (matching mtime + size), so an edited or replaced WAV is detected and re-hashed; `--rescan` recomputes unconditionally. Per-file failures (non-48 kHz, libsndfile errors) print a stderr warning and the scan continues. `--remove <basename>` forgets a single entry. Use this to bulk-register a whole IR library at once; use `register-irs` for one-off binding from a preset.
- `helixgen list-irs` — print `<hash>  <wav-path>` for every registered IR.
- `helixgen analyze-audio <capture.wav> [--json]` — offline audio-quality metrics from a WAV capture (LUFS per BS.1770, crest factor, clipping, spectral centroid, 5-band guitar-vocabulary energies; backlog #62 phase 3). Needs numpy (`pip install 'helixgen[analyze]'`). EXPERIMENTAL `--record N -o out.wav` captures from an audio input first (`helixgen[capture]`, sounddevice/PortAudio; untested on hardware). Read-only + offline; full contract in `analyze-audio --help` and [`docs/CLI.md`](docs/CLI.md). Band edges are provisional pending reconciliation with the IR catalog's measured-tag pass.
- `helixgen ir-cache --stats | --clear | --prune` — inspect/maintain the IR-hash **cache** (a pure-local perf layer that memoizes expensive Stadium-hash computes, keyed by absolute path + mtime + size; **not** `mapping.json`). `--stats` prints entry count, path, and size; `--clear` deletes the cache file; `--prune` drops entries whose backing WAV is gone. Default location `~/.helixgen/cache/irhash.json` (override with `$HELIXGEN_IRHASH_CACHE`, or `$HELIXGEN_CACHE` for the cache dir). All IR-hashing paths (`register-irs`, `ir-scan`, `irhash`) share it transparently.

Example: `helixgen ir-scan ~/IRs && helixgen list-irs | wc -l`.

### `helixgen device` — network control of a Helix Stadium (2.0+)

Talks to a **Stadium** over the LAN directly (OSC-over-ZeroMQ; no editor app).
Requires the `device` extra (`pip install 'helixgen[device]'` → pyzmq+msgpack).
Point at the device with `--ip`/`--port` or `$HELIXGEN_HELIX_IP` (precedence:
`--ip` > env var > built-in default `192.168.4.84`). **Stadium-only**; these
verbs **mutate the device** — prefer an empty/expendable slot when testing.

**The full per-verb reference — every flag and gotcha — lives
in [`docs/CLI.md`](docs/CLI.md) "Device commands".** The rest of this section is
the verb index plus the mental-model rules that must stay in front of an agent.

- **Preset + edit buffer:** `device list` / `setlists` / `info` / `active`
  (the ACTIVE preset's cid/name/slot — save/restore the player's selection) /
  `read` / `load` / `create` / `save` / `rename` / `delete` / `set-param` /
  `blocks` / `params` (a block's numeric pids + names + CURRENT raw values —
  run it before `set-param`; block coordinates are DSP **grid slots**, 0-27) /
  `pull` / `push` / `restore` / `backup` / `local-list` / `watch` /
  `set-info` / `install`. The `--setlist` option on
  list/backup/create/save/push/install/delete/`slots restore` takes `user`
  (the pool, default), `factory`, or a **real device setlist name** (its
  entries are references to pool presets). `install` transcodes a helixgen
  `.hsp` straight into device content (`_sbepgsm`) — no template, full
  fidelity (dual-amp, parallel splits, snapshots, footswitch/EXP assignments
  all synthesized); `--auto-irs` uploads referenced IRs (EXPERIMENTAL).
- **Live device ops (mutate the ACTIVE tone):** `device snapshot <index>`
  (recall a snapshot), `device bypass <path> <block> <on|off>` (volatile block
  bypass), `device model <path> <block> <model>` (live model swap), `device
  reorder <setlist> <target> --to <N>` (direct DEVICE-side preset reorder —
  distinct from the local-manifest `device slots reorder`; numeric args are
  **cid-first**), `device tuner` / `device meters` / `device measure` (read-only 2003 telemetry; `measure` = playing-gated loudness stats, backlog #62).
  Decoded + HW-validated 2026-07-14. `device normalize` (#62 phase 2) is the
  closed loop over `measure`: level-match a preset's NAMED snapshots or a
  manifest setlist while the player plays — DRY-RUN by default; `--yes`
  writes the dB trims into the LOCAL `.hsp` only (per-snapshot / base
  output `level`; the device follows via `sync`). Output-gain trims are
  dB-exact but sit downstream of every meter tap, so the loop trusts the
  math (deliberately never re-measures to confirm). Holds `editbuffer`
  even in dry-run (it recalls snapshots / loads presets while measuring).
- **Global Settings + Global EQ:** `device settings list|get|set` (161 `global.*`
  keys; enum labels validated) and `device globaleq list|set <output> <band>
  <param> <value>` (three per-output-layer 7-band EQs; **write-only** — no
  network read-back).
- **IRs on the device:** `device list-irs` (read-only; the device's user IRs —
  distinct from the local `helixgen list-irs`), `device push-ir` (instant import
  under helixgen's exact `irhash`), `device pull-ir` (EXPERIMENTAL), `device
  delete-ir`, `device rename-ir`, `device ir-prune` (delete unreferenced IRs;
  dry-run by default, two independent consents `--force` / `--ignore-warnings`).
- **Setlists + sync:** `device setlist create|rename|delete|duplicate`
  (device-side; never orphan pool presets), `device setlist
  list|add|remove|create-local` (local manifest membership), `device setlist
  import-hss` / `export-hss` (EXPERIMENTAL `.hss` setlist-bundle import **and**
  byte-faithful export; filled slot = embedded `.hsp`), `device sync
  <setlist>` / `device sync --all [--gc]` (pool-first, reference-rebuilding,
  IR-uploading, idempotent; **not** a destructive mirror). `--repush` (either
  form) forces a content re-push of every in-scope tone already in the pool
  even when its `.hsp` hash is unchanged — use once after a helixgen
  transcoder upgrade, since hash-based change detection can't see a
  transcoder-output change on its own (backlog #25 residual).
- **Tone library / slots:** `helixgen register`, `device add` / `unsync` /
  `library` / `slots [list|restore|reorder] [--verify]`, `device setlist
  sync-on|sync-off`.

**Device-write gating.** Verbs that only read or list device state are safe —
e.g. `info`, `active`, `read`, `list`, `list-irs`, `blocks`, `params`,
`settings list`/`get`,
`tuner`, `meters`, `measure`, `watch`, `backup`, `pull`/`pull-ir`, plus the offline verbs
(`local-list`, `library`, `slots list`, `globaleq list`, `--list`/`--dry-run`
variants). Anything that writes content, properties, or files **mutates the
device** — the live-ops verbs change the ACTIVE tone immediately. When unsure,
check the verb's entry in [`docs/CLI.md`](docs/CLI.md). Prefer an
empty/expendable slot when testing.

**Machine-local advisory device locks (0.22.0).** Every device-mutating verb
auto-acquires a lease file (`~/.helixgen/locks/<ip>/<scope>.lock`, override
root `$HELIXGEN_LOCKS`) for its duration, so concurrent helixgen processes on
this machine never collide on the device; read-only verbs take nothing.
Scopes: `editbuffer` (live-ops on the ACTIVE tone), `library` (pool/setlist/
content writes), `irs` (device IR writes), `globals` (Global Settings/EQ
writes), `all` (exclusive session lease). Hold scopes across calls with
`device lock --scope all --label <who>` (export the printed
`HELIXGEN_LOCK_TOKEN` so your own verbs pass through; same-shell calls pass
through automatically), inspect with `device lock --status [--json]`, release
with `device unlock`. Contended verbs wait `$HELIXGEN_LOCK_TIMEOUT` s
(default 30, 0 = fail fast) then error naming the holder; stale leases
(expired TTL / dead pid — session leases get a 120 s dead-pid grace, so run
`device lock` from a long-lived shell, not a wrapper script) are reclaimed,
live ones never. `--no-lock` per-verb opts out (dangerous). Advisory +
machine-local only — other hosts and the Stadium desktop editor are NOT
covered; pid-liveness is POSIX-only (TTL-only staleness on Windows). Full
verb → scope table: [`docs/CLI.md`](docs/CLI.md) "Device locks".

**The Stadium's network stack is flaky — if a sync/verb drops or stalls,
re-run it: `sync` and the live-ops verbs are idempotent + auto-reconnecting;
the slot-writing verbs (install/save/push/create) fail safe on an occupied
slot instead; `setlist import-hss` is the one NOT-idempotent retry. If it
keeps dropping, reboot the Helix.**

**The tone library is the single management record.** Every tone helixgen
generates auto-registers into the manifest, now at
`~/.helixgen/setlists/manifest.json` (override `$HELIXGEN_SETLISTS`; a legacy
`~/.helixgen/setlists.json` v2 manifest auto-migrates up to the new location
on first load — see "Home directory and git plumbing" below). A **tone** =
content + identity + management **intent**; its desired **user slot**
(`null` = off device, `"auto"` = wants device, or `"1A".."128D"`) plus its
**setlist memberships**. **"On the device" ⟺ the tone has a slot.** There is
no separate slot ledger. Presets are addressed by integer **CID**; a preset
lives once in the **pool** (`-2`) and is referenced by **setlists** under the
setlists root `-5`. **Sync is a managed-set mirror** — it
installs/updates/reorders/deletes only the tones helixgen manages and
**never touches untracked device presets**. A specific Helix's **observed**
placement (`cid`/`posi`) is not part of the manifest — see below.

**Pushing tones to the device is driven by the `device` skill** (in the
plugin repo, `sheax0r/helixgen`), which runs after `tone` has authored the `.hsp` and
centers on `device sync <setlist>`. Read it before
scripting a setlist sync. Design + protocol refs:
[`docs/CLI.md`](docs/CLI.md), `docs/helix-protocol.md`, and
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-13-tone-library-model-redesign.md`.

## IR cab-pack catalog (character reference)

The IR library at `irs/` (gitignored — paid packs stay local) carries a
grep-first tonal catalog at `irs/_catalog/`. It answers "which IR is beefiest /
brightest / best for a vintage clean / tightest for modern metal" without
re-analysing WAVs. Start at `irs/_catalog/README.md` (index + controlled tag
vocabulary + mic legend + example greps); one file per pack holds per-mix mic
combos and character tags.

**When a new IR pack is added to `irs/`, catalog it before moving on:**
1. Read the pack's `*Manual*.pdf` — cab/speaker/amp, mic legend, per-mix mic
   combos, and any artist/usage notes.
2. `ls` the pack's `Mixes/` folder for the exact WAV basenames (these are what a
   preset's cab block references via `mapping.json`).
3. Optionally FFT-analyse each Mix WAV (stdlib `wave` + `numpy`, 5 guitar bands)
   for measured bright/dark/beefy/tight tags — relative *within* the pack.
4. Write `irs/_catalog/<slug>.md` from the template in the catalog README, using
   ONLY the controlled vocabulary; add a row to the README index table.

Don't invent character the manual doesn't state, but well-established general
knowledge is fine (Greenback = classic-rock, V30 = modern metal, ribbon = warm
top, SM7 = fat). The catalog README's "Adding a new pack" section is the
authoritative procedure and self-documenting template.

## Architecture: `.hsp` is the source of truth

A `.hsp` file is the 8-byte magic `rpshnosj` followed by a JSON document — it
**is** the canonical, editable artifact. There is no persisted intermediary
spec and **no `.spec.json` sidecar**. Two flows act on it:

- **Author** a new preset by feeding a transient **recipe** (the JSON shape
  below) to `generate`; helixgen clones the chassis template and replays the
  recipe as in-place mutations. The recipe is input-only — it is not written to
  disk and is never read back as truth.
- **Edit** an existing `.hsp` with the surgical verbs (`set-param`, `enable`,
  `add-block`, …); each reads the `.hsp`, mutates its body in place, and writes
  the `.hsp` back. No recompile, no sidecar.

To read a `.hsp` back into the recipe shape (for inspection or hand-authoring a
similar preset), use `helixgen view <preset.hsp>` — a read-only projection.

## recipe shape (author input to `generate`)

The **recipe** is the JSON author-input to `generate`. It is
input-only — never written to disk, never read back as truth. The base shape:

```json
{
  "name": "Preset Display Name",
  "author": "you",
  "paths": [
    {
      "blocks": [
        {"block": "Compulsive Drive", "params": {"Gain": 0.45, "Tone": 0.55}},
        {"block": "Brit Plexi Brt",   "params": {"Drive": 0.7, "Master": 0.5}},
        {"block": "Mic Ir_4x12 Greenback 25 With Pan"},
        {"block": "Tape Echo Stereo", "params": {"Mix": 0.18}},
        {"block": "Plate Stereo",     "params": {"Mix": 0.12}}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- `paths` is 1–2 entries (each maps to one DSP).
- `block` matches the display_name from `list-blocks` — case-sensitive. If ambiguous, use the model_id in brackets (e.g. "HD2_AmpBritPlexiBrt").
- `params` values are floats 0.0–1.0 for most knobs; some are ints/bools/Hz. Verify ranges with `show-block`.

**The exhaustive per-field reference — every optional section with its full
schema, defaults, ranges, and examples — lives in
[`docs/recipe-reference.md`](docs/recipe-reference.md).** The optional top-level
/ per-path fields, one line each:

- **`input`** (per path) — jack routing (`inst1`/`inst2`/`both`/`none`) plus the Input-block params (impedance ladder, pad, trim, gate, StereoLink).
- **`output`** (per path) — output block `level` (dB) + `pan`.
- **`split`/`join`** (in `blocks`) — parallel splits: split `type` (`y`/`ab`/`crossover`/`dynamic`) + merge-mixer wire params (`"A Level"`, `"B Pan"`, master `"Level"` — default **+3 dB**, write `0.0` for unity).
- **`snapshots`** (top-level, ≤8) — named scenes: per-scene `disable` + `params` deltas; snapshot 0 active on load.
- **`footswitches`** (top-level) — assign blocks/params to `FS1`–`FS5`/`FS7`–`FS11`/`EXP1Toe` (FS6/FS12 reserved); merge switches, param toggles, scribble `label`/`color`, response `curve`.
- **`expression`** (top-level) — sweep params with `EXP1`/`EXP2`; per-target `min`/`max` (reverse sweep supported).
- **`midi`** (top-level, EXPERIMENTAL #33) — bind MIDI CC# to param sweeps / bypass toggles. CC-only; realized on `device install`/`sync`.
- **`commands`** (top-level, EXPERIMENTAL #16) — Command Center: a footswitch / `Instant` slot **sends** a MIDI PC/CC/Note/MMC message or a Preset/Snapshot action.
- **`ir`** (per IR block) — load a registered user IR by wav basename or 32-hex hash.
- **`trails`** (per delay/reverb/FX-loop block) — bool: whether the wet tail rings out on bypass / snapshot switch.
- **`raw`** (per block) — verbatim unmodeled bNN state (`harness`, extra `slots`); emitted by `view`, consumed by `generate`. Editing an existing `.hsp` never needs it.

**One-controller-per-param.** A `(block, param)` is driven by at most one of
footswitch-param / expression / MIDI across the whole spec (a block's *bypass*
may have several sources).

**Controller vocabulary & English rendering (agent behavior).** When reporting a
tone to a human, render controllers in English (via
`helixgen controllers` / `controllers.english_for_controller`), never
a bare `FS#` (e.g. `Footswitch 5 (top row, 5th from left)`). When a human
*describes* a control in plain language, translate it to a canonical identifier
with a dedicated small-model sub-agent fed `helixgen controllers --json` — it
returns exactly one identifier (or `AMBIGUOUS`/`NONE`); validate it against the
canonical set before writing it into a recipe. `view` never drops controls it
can't map — it keeps them under a top-level `unknown_controllers` list
(round-trip safe). Full detail in [`docs/recipe-reference.md`](docs/recipe-reference.md).

All recipe fields are **Stadium-only** unless noted; the legacy `.hlx` chassis
ignores the Stadium-specific ones (with or without a warning per field — see the
reference).

## User preferences (`preferences.json`)

The `setup` / `tone` skills (plugin repo) read explicit settings from a user-editable JSON
file — `~/.helixgen/preferences.json` (override the whole-file location with
`$HELIXGEN_PREFS`; override any single key with `HELIXGEN_<KEY>`, e.g.
`HELIXGEN_FAVOR_IRS=1`). Loaded by `src/helixgen/preferences.py`; per-key
precedence is env var > file value > built-in default. Keys include
`device.model`, `favor_irs`, `reveal_in_finder`, `guard_paid_irs_in_git`,
`preset_output_dir`, `author`, `default_guitar`, `instruments`, and
`git_commit_tones` (default `"auto"` — the skills git-commit changed tone/IR
artifacts when the target directory is git-managed; see the skill files in the
plugin repo).

- **`default_guitar`** (string, default `null`) — which of the user's
  `instruments` to default to when a tone request doesn't name a guitar. Env
  override `HELIXGEN_DEFAULT_GUITAR`. When unset and the `tone` skill needs a
  guitar, the skill asks the user and offers to save the answer here.

## Tone naming and the library

**Naming schema (supersedes the old `"<Tone Name> — <Guitar>"` convention).**
A tone's display name is `"$Artist - $Song - $Guitar"`, or `"$Descriptor -
$Guitar"` when the tone has no artist/song (guitar = the target guitar's
short name). The guitar segment is omitted only for a tone that's explicitly
guitar-agnostic (generic patch). Filenames are the same schema, slugged
lowercase-with-dashes (e.g. `foo-fighters-white-limo-les-paul-jr.hsp`). Guitar
resolution order in the `tone` skill: a user-named guitar wins; else
`default_guitar`; else the skill asks and offers to save the choice as
`default_guitar`.

**Logical tone vs. variant.** A **logical tone** — one artist+song, or one
descriptor — owns exactly one metadata JSON at
`library/tones/<logical-slug>.json`, plus one or more **variants**, each a
real `.hsp` targeting a single guitar and keyed by that guitar's profile slug
(or `"generic"` for a guitar-agnostic variant). The manifest and the device
still key by the *variant's* display name — that's what a device preset is;
the metadata JSON just groups variants that share an artist/song/descriptor
identity. Creating a new variant of an existing tone is `generate --guitar
<other-guitar>` against the same artist/song/descriptor.

The companion write-up that used to be a `.md` sidecar next to the `.hsp` is
now folded into the tone metadata's `description_md` (no sidecar file) —
authored/updated via `helixgen library doc` (see below). Per-variant notes
live in that variant's `notes_md`.

## The `helixgen library` verb group

New verb group over `library/tones/*.json` (guitar profiles / per-IR metadata
are later-PR — see "Home directory and git plumbing" above). Every
library-mutating verb auto-commits the home repo afterward (advisory, gated
by the `git_commit_tones` preference, same posture as tone auto-registration).

- `helixgen library list [--tones|--guitars|--irs] [--json]` — list tones
  (plus guitars/IRs sections, always empty until their later-PR verbs ship).
- `helixgen library show <name> [--json]` — one tone's metadata: compact
  human summary, or the exact on-disk JSON with `--json`. `<name>` resolves
  as the logical slug, the metadata filename, or any variant's `preset_name`.
- `helixgen describe <tone>` — the longer, human-oriented counterpart to
  `library show`: identity, tags, a variants table, and the full
  `description_md` verbatim.
- `helixgen library doc <name> (--from-file <md> | -) [--variant <guitar>]` —
  set the tone's `description_md`, or (with `--variant`) one variant's
  `notes_md`. This is now how a tone's write-up gets authored — no more `.md`
  sidecars.
- `helixgen library validate [--json]` — shape + cross-link checks (variant
  `.hsp` exists, `preset_name` matches the manifest, guitar slug is known)
  across every tone; exits 1 if any problems are found. **The guitar-slug
  check is inert in this release** — with no `library/guitars/` yet, it falls
  back to accepting whatever variant keys are already in use instead of a
  real profile lookup; a later PR (guitar profiles) makes it exact.
- `helixgen library import <file.hsp|dir> [--artist --song | --descriptor]
  [--guitar] [--keep-source]` — bring an external `.hsp` into the library
  under the naming schema (moves by default; `--keep-source` copies), folding
  a sibling `.md` into `description_md` if present.
- `helixgen library migrate [--dry-run | --plan <plan.json>]` — one-shot,
  idempotent migration of a pre-library `~/.helixgen` (existing tones + IR
  mapping + manifest) into the new library layout; `--dry-run` prints an
  editable plan to correct before executing.

## Surgical edits

Once a preset exists, don't re-author it to change one setting — use the edit
verbs below. Each reads the `.hsp`, mutates its body **in place**, and writes
the `.hsp` back, reusing all of helixgen's validation, model-id translation,
and IR injection. Works on ANY `.hsp` — one helixgen authored or a raw device
export — with no decompile step and no sidecar.

**Mental model:** the `.hsp` is the source of truth. An edit verb loads it,
applies one change to the verbose device-native JSON, and saves it. Fields
helixgen doesn't model (dual-cab slots, harness, `xyctrl`, …) are preserved
untouched by construction.

**Run `helixgen show-block "<block>"` first** to confirm the exact,
case-sensitive param name — the same guardrail `generate` already enforces.

- `helixgen set-param <preset> <block> <param> <value> [--snapshot NAME_OR_INDEX] [--path/--lane/--pos]` — set one param on one block; `<value>` is auto-coerced (bool → int → float → string). A **negative** value needs the `--` sentinel after any flags (`helixgen set-param t.hsp output level -- -3`). `--snapshot <name-or-0-based-index>` writes the value into that ONE snapshot's slot of the param's per-snapshot overrides array instead of the base (requires an existing base value; untouched slots densify to it) — round-trips through `view`, realized on-device by `install`/`sync`. The block names `input` / `output` / `split` / `join` (`merge` = alias) are **signal-flow pseudo-blocks** addressing the path's endpoints / split / merge mixer (`--path` picks the DSP; `--pos` disambiguates two splits; `--lane` does not apply): input params use the recipe vocabulary (`impedance`, `pad`, `trim`, `gate`, `threshold`, `decay`, `link`), output params are `level`/`pan` (the only pseudo-block supporting `--snapshot`), split/join params are the wire names (`BalanceA`, `Frequency`, `"A Level"`, …).
- `helixgen enable <preset> <block> [--snapshot NAME] [--path/--lane/--pos]` — un-bypass a block at base level, or (with `--snapshot`) enable it in that snapshot.
- `helixgen disable <preset> <block> [--snapshot NAME] [--path/--lane/--pos]` — bypass a block at base level, or (with `--snapshot`) bypass it in that snapshot.
- `helixgen add-block <preset> <block> [--path N] [--after NAME]` — insert a block (append to `--path`, default 0, or after a named block).
- `helixgen remove-block <preset> <block> [--path/--lane/--pos]` — delete a block.
- `helixgen swap-model <preset> <old> <new> [--path/--lane/--pos]` — replace a block with another of the **same category**; carries over params the target shares, warns on any it has to drop.
- `helixgen view <preset.hsp> [-o recipe.json]` — read-only projection of a `.hsp` into the recipe shape (replaces `decompile`; the dump is non-authoritative).

`--path`/`--lane`/`--pos` disambiguate when a block name appears more than once
in the preset (e.g. dual-cab, both lanes of a split). (`--index` was removed in
1.0.0 — block addressing is `(path, lane, pos)`.) `--snapshot` applies to
`enable`/`disable` (per-snapshot bypass) and `set-param` (per-snapshot value).

For a multi-edit session, **`helixgen patch <preset.hsp> <ops.json>`** applies
a JSON **list** of `{op, ...}` operations (`set_param`, `set_enabled`,
`add_block`, `remove_block`, `swap_model`) in one atomic invocation: all ops
are applied in memory and the file is written once at the end, so an invalid
op anywhere in the list leaves the `.hsp` untouched (never half-patched).
`ops.json` may be `-` for stdin; `--json` emits `{path, warnings}`. Op fields
mirror the single-op verbs' flags (`"path"`/`"lane"`/`"pos"`, `"snapshot"`,
the signal-flow pseudo-blocks). The agent edit loop is a single `patch` call
on the file — no decompile/regenerate round-trip.

### Worked examples

**Change a delay's Mix:**

```bash
helixgen show-block "Tape Echo Stereo"        # confirm the param is "Mix"
helixgen set-param MyTone.hsp "Tape Echo Stereo" Mix 0.3
# mutates MyTone.hsp in place (no sidecar)
```

**Disable a block (kill the reverb):**

```bash
helixgen disable MyTone.hsp "Plate Stereo"
# add --snapshot Lead to bypass it only in the "Lead" snapshot
```

**Swap an amp:**

```bash
helixgen list-blocks --category amp          # find the exact target display name
helixgen swap-model MyTone.hsp "Brit Plexi Brt" "Brit 2204"
# same-category only; carries over shared params, warns on any it had to drop
# (surface any warnings to the user)
```

**Several edits at once (atomic):**

```bash
echo '[{"op": "set_param", "block": "Tape Echo Stereo", "param": "Mix", "value": 0.3},
       {"op": "set_enabled", "block": "Plate Stereo", "enabled": false}]' \
  | helixgen patch MyTone.hsp -
```

Disambiguate duplicate block names (e.g. two cabs across a split) with
`--pos`/`--lane`/`--path` on the single-op verbs, or `"pos"`/`"lane"`/`"path"`
on a `patch` op.

## Generation notes

- The chassis is whatever was first ingested. A Stadium chassis (`_helixgen_chassis_shape: "hsp"`) produces `.hsp` output; a `.hlx` chassis produces `.hlx`. Carryover `meta.color` / `meta.info` / `device_id` from the originating export is currently expected.
- Some Stadium model IDs are translated on ingest (e.g. `HD2_DistScream808Mono` → `HD2_DrvScream808`); generate translates back when writing `.hsp`.
- If the param validator fails with a list of valid names, run `show-block` and correct the recipe — don't guess.

## Project layout

- `src/helixgen/` — `cli` (core verbs + entry point), `cli_device` (the `helixgen device` verb group, imported back into `cli`), `ingest`, `hsp`, `chassis`, `library`, `spec` (recipe parser/validator), `mutate` (in-place `.hsp` edit verbs), `recipe` (author `.hsp` from a recipe), `view` (read-only `.hsp` → recipe projection), `generate` (shared low-level `.hsp` builders + legacy `.hlx`), `controllers`, `preferences`, `bootstrap`, `ir`, `irhash_cache`, `locks` (machine-local advisory device locks)
- `src/helixgen/device/` — network device control (OSC-over-ZeroMQ client, `transcode`, `modelmap`, `defs`, setlist manifest)
- `docs/` — `BACKLOG.md` (THE backlog), `CLI.md` (the full CLI + per-verb **device** reference), `recipe-reference.md` (the exhaustive recipe field reference), `superpowers/specs/` (design docs + review findings), `superpowers/plans/` (implementation plans), `features/` (per-feature deep dives), protocol references (`helix-protocol.md`, `helix-format-reference.md`, `helix-sftp-access.md`, `ir-hash-algorithm.md`)
- `tests/` — pytest suite (run with `PYTHONPATH=$PWD/src python -m pytest`); the golden-output contract (`tests/golden/`) and the 211-export real-device round-trip (`tests/test_decompile_acceptance.py`) pin `.hsp` fidelity
- `tests/live/` — **opt-in live integration suite** (backlog #66): drives the real CLI via subprocess against the real library and a real Stadium. Skipped unless `HELIXGEN_LIVE=1` (device tests also need the device reachable — TCP probe of port 2002; the device ignores ICMP). Impact-area markers (registered in `pyproject.toml`): `authoring`, `library`, `ir`, `device_read`, `device_write`, `liveops`, `setlists`, `sync`, `device_ir`, `locks` (the advisory device locks: session-lease visibility, foreign-process blocking, token passthrough, `--no-lock`), plus `live` on everything and `live_global` (extra opt-in `HELIXGEN_LIVE_GLOBAL=1` for the read→set-same→verify global-settings write). The suite holds the real `all` device lock for the whole run (label `live-test-suite`) and passes its own calls through via `HELIXGEN_LOCK_TOKEN`. After a targeted change run its blast radius, e.g. `HELIXGEN_LIVE=1 PYTHONPATH=$PWD/src python -m pytest -m "live and sync" tests/live`. Safety = fixtures: scratch env for ALL local state, upfront `device backup`, before/after device-state diff (the suite fails itself on a leak), `HGTEST`-prefixed artifacts with teardown-on-failure, and a session check that the real `~/.helixgen` files are byte-identical afterwards. `tests/live/conftest.py` documents the full safety model + deliberately excluded verbs (`restore`, `sync --all`, `bootstrap`, `globaleq set`, real-cache `ir-cache --clear`). Known live gotchas are encoded as xfails: backlog #38 /CreateContent status-1 episodes (save/install/setlist create), the IR-registry non-listing wedge, and amp-pid-1-only live `set-param` (#67).
- `tests/fixtures/` — synthetic + real-export fixtures
- `data/` (gitignored) — the user's personal `.hsp` exports
- `irs/` (gitignored) — paid commercial IR packs; character catalog at `irs/_catalog/`

## Development workflow

- **Worktrees, branched from fresh `github/main`.** All non-trivial work happens
  in a git worktree whose branch starts from freshly-fetched `github/main` (the
  GitHub remote is named **`github`**, not `origin`) — never commit directly on
  local `main`; it may be stale. Fetch again before picking a release version
  number (a concurrent PR once released 2.10.0 mid-flight and collided with an
  in-progress bump).
- **Adversarial review before shipping.** Before merging a PR, dispatch at least
  one independent review subagent prompted to *break* the change (find bugs,
  regressions, spec violations — not summarize it). Confirmed findings are fixed
  or explicitly deferred to `docs/BACKLOG.md`. Major changes also get a committed
  review doc in `docs/superpowers/specs/` (see the PR #31 review for the shape).
- **Agent-facing surfaces ship in sync.** The CLI is the only engine surface;
  its per-verb `--help` text is the agent contract (pinned by
  `tests/test_cli_parity.py`). Any change to CLI-visible behavior updates, in
  the same PR, every surface in this repo that describes it: the verb's help
  text, this CLAUDE.md, and `docs/CLI.md`. Drift between code and these
  surfaces is a bug, not a docs chore. Behavior changes that skills describe
  also need a companion PR in the plugin repo (`sheax0r/helixgen`,
  `.claude/skills/*`) — land the two together and note the cross-repo pairing
  in both PR descriptions.
- **Backlog discipline.** `docs/BACKLOG.md` is the single project backlog.
  Deferred work gets a numbered entry there — not a TODO comment, not a
  side file.
- TDD throughout: failing test first, then minimal implementation. See existing test files for the established pattern.
- Pure stdlib + `click` for the CLI; no other runtime deps.
- Real-export fixtures live in `tests/fixtures/presets/` and are loaded by tests under skip-if-not-present guards so the suite stays green on a clean clone.

## Releasing

This repo releases the **`helixgen` PyPI package** (version in
`pyproject.toml` + `src/helixgen/__init__.py` — bump both together; the
version feeds generated presets' `meta`). Publishing is via the OIDC
trusted-publisher workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) on `vX.Y.Z`
tags pushed to `main` (first publish 0.19.1).

Plugin releases (the `stable` branch + `helixgen--vX.Y.Z` tags) live in the
**plugin repo** (`sheax0r/helixgen`) and are owned by its release workflow —
nothing in this repo moves those refs. When a core release changes behavior a
skill depends on, cut the core release first, then bump the plugin's pinned
`helixgen` version in its own PR.
